# Covid Detecion
In this repository, we read a dataset of X-ray images, which includes classes: Covid, Normal, Lung Opacity and Viral Pneumonia.
Then we classify the data using different networks such as Cnn, EffiecientNet_V2_S, Swin Transformer and CnnTransformer.
EffiecientNet_V2_S and Swin Transformer networks are trained by fine tune or transfer learning method and Cnn and CnnTransformer networks are trained with initial weights.

## Dataste
The dataset that has been trained and evaluated with that model is the dataset of x-ray images. This dataset contains 25,103 images and includes four classes: Covid, Normal, Lung Opacity and Viral Pneumonia.

21,165 images are related to the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database'>COVID-19 Radiography Database</a>, and 317 images are related to the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset'>Covid-19 Image dataset</a>, and 3,621 images are also related to the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unaissait/curated-chest-xray-image-dataset-for-covid19'>Curated Chest X-Ray Image Dataset for COVID-19</a>.

The reason why images from different datasets were used is to improve the data distribution of each class to avoid biasing the model or network on one of the classes.
